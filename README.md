Values greater than 1.0 will increase the saturation, making the colors more vibrant.

### Brightness Factor:
Range: Typically, 0.0 to 2.0
Effect:
0.0 will give you a completely black image.
1.0 will leave the image unchanged.
Values greater than 1.0 will increase the brightness, making the image lighter.


### Contrast Factor:
Range: Typically, 0.0 to 2.0
Effect:
0.0 will give you a solid gray image with no contrast.
1.0 will leave the image unchanged.
Values greater than 1.0 will increase the contrast, making the dark areas darker and the light areas lighter.
